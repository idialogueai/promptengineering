(bulleted list of Customer products here)

* user: How many USB-C ports are included with the Axis 5000 server?
* function: `search_product_catalog( product: 'Axis 5000', query: 'How many USB-C ports?')`
* system: The Axis 5000 supports 4 USB-C ports.

* function: `search_kb(query: 'Axis 5000 USB-C port blue light blinking)`
* system: It appears the bus connector may be detached from the USB-C port. The blinking blue light indicates that power is available, but there is no data connection.
